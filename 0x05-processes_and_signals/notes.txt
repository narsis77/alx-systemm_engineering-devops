4. To infinity and beyond
In this script, the while loop runs indefinitely because the condition true is always true. 
Within the loop, it echoes the message "To infinity and beyond" 
and then pauses execution for 2 seconds using the sleep command. 
The loop continues to repeat this process indefinitely until it is interrupted.

-kill "$(pgrep -f 4-to_infinity_and_beyond)": executes a command to kill the process with the name "4-to_infinity_and_beyond"
-The pgrep command is used to search for processes based on their names or attributes.
-The -f option allows for a full pattern match. 
So, in this case, it searches for a process with the name "4-to_infinity_and_beyond". 
The output of this command is the PID (Process ID) of the matching process.
-The $(...) syntax is used to capture the output of a command and substitute it into the overall command. 
In this case, it captures the PID of the process found by pgrep.
-The kill command is used to send a signal to a process, requesting it to terminate. 
In this script, the captured PID is passed as an argument to the kill command, indicating that the process with that PID should be terminated.
-Therefore, the script's purpose is to find the process with the name "4-to_infinity_and_beyond" using pgrep, capture its PID, 
and then use the kill command to terminate that process.
