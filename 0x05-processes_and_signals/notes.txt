4. To infinity and beyond
In this script, the while loop runs indefinitely because the condition true is always true. 
Within the loop, it echoes the message "To infinity and beyond" 
and then pauses execution for 2 seconds using the sleep command. 
The loop continues to repeat this process indefinitely until it is interrupted.
