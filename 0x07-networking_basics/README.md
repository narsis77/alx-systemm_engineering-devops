## OSI MODEL

> The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a communication system into seven distinct layers.

> It helps in understanding and describing how different network protocols and technologies interact to enable communication between networked devices. Each layer in the OSI model has a specific set of functions and responsibilities.

> The layers are:
* Application layer
* Presentation layer
* Session layer
* Transport layer
* Network layer
* Data link layer
* Physical layer

## LAN

> LAN stands for Local Area Network. It is a computer network that connects devices within a limited geographical area, such as a home, office building, or school campus. A LAN is designed to facilitate communication and resource sharing between devices in close proximity to each other.

### Typical Usage

> File and Resource Sharing: LANs enable users to share files, documents, printers, scanners, and other resources within the network. This allows for easy collaboration and access to shared resources.

> Local Application Hosting: LANs can host applications or services that are accessible to users within the network. For example, a LAN might host a local file server or a database server that is used by multiple devices.
> Internet Access Sharing: LANs often provide a gateway to the internet, allowing multiple devices within the network to share a single internet connection. This is commonly achieved through a router that connects the LAN to the internet.

> Local Multiplayer Gaming: LANs are popular for hosting local multiplayer gaming sessions. Players can connect their devices to the LAN and play games together, utilizing the low-latency and high-speed connectivity offered by the network.

### Typical Geographical Size

> The range of a LAN is typically limited to a few hundred meters to a few kilometers, and it is often confined to a single site or location. To connect multiple LANs together over a larger area, additional networking technologies like Wide Area Networks (WANs) or the internet may be used.

> Home Network: A LAN in a typical home network would cover the devices within the house or apartment.

> Office LAN: In an office environment, a LAN would typically cover a floor, a building, or a group of buildings in close proximity.

> School Campus: LANs in educational institutions, such as schools or universities, can cover an entire campus or a specific area within the campus.
