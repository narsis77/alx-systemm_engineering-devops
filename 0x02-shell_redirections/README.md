In this directory I am writing scripts for standard inputs and standard output in shell
The first script prints “Hello, World”, followed by a new line to the standard output.
The second script displays a confused smiley "(Ôo)'.
The thrid script Display the content of the /etc/passwd file.
the fourth script Display the content of /etc/passwd and /etc/hosts
The fifth script Display the last 10 lines of /etc/passwd
the sixth script Display the first 10 lines of /etc/passwd
the seventh script displays the third line of the file iacta.
the eith script creates a file named exactly \*\\'"Best School"\'\\*$\?\*\*\*\*\*:) containing the text Best School ending by a new line.
the nineth script writes into the file ls_cwd_content the result of the command ls -la. If the file ls_cwd_content already exists, it should be overwritten. If the file ls_cwd_content does not exist, create it.
the tenth script duplicates the last line of the file iacta
the eleventh script deletes all the regular files (not the directories) with a .js extension that are present in the current directory and all its subfolders.
